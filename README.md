# You can install the required libraries using the following command:
# pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
# git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-analysis-project.git
# cd data-analysis-project
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# Open the Jupyter Notebooks and run the cells to perform the data analysis.
# In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the notebooks/ directory and open the desired notebook file.
# # Example usage in a Jupyter Notebook cell:

import src.data_loader as dl
import src.analysis as an
import src.visualization as vz

# Load the data
data = dl.load_data('data/dataset.csv')

# Clean the data
cleaned_data = dl.clean_data(data)

# Perform analysis
analysis_results = an.perform_analysis(cleaned_data)

# Visualize the results
vz.visualize_results(analysis_results)
